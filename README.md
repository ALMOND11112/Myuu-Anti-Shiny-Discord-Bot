# Myuu-Anti-Shiny-Discord-Bot

# Why I made it?
Since, I was legit fed up of NebbyBot's lag (not criticising it), I decided to make my own but in python and host it in replit. It took me around 2hrs at max. 

# How to use it?
1. Download Python (3.8 or higher preferred)
2. Clone or download the repo. (unzip if downloaded)
3. Do cd Myuu-Anti-Shiny-Discord-Bot and then pip install -r requirements.txt

# Any upcoming features?
- [] Look at multiple channels.
- [] Anti- Starter killing

# Note: I just used the idea of Nebby Bot, didn't copy it. NebbyBot is most probably written in discord.js, while this is written in python.
